        <p>
            <strong>Ancient Ward</strong> is a combat and dungeon-focused Unreal Engine prototype
            built as a progression from earlier gameplay experiments. The project expands
            on core combat mechanics by introducing structured level flow, weapon pickups,
            timed challenges, and a complete dungeon experience culminating in a boss fight.

<!-- DETAILED EXPLANATION -->
<section class="wrapper style1">
    <div class="title">Development Breakdown</div>
    <div class="container">

        <h3>Progression From Previous Project</h3>
        <p>
            Ancient Ward was designed as a direct step forward from earlier gameplay prototypes.
            Instead of focusing on a single mechanic, this project brings multiple systems
            together into a cohesive dungeon-style experience. The goal was to understand
            how individual gameplay systems interact when combined into a full level flow.
        </p>

        <h3>Dungeon-Style Level Design</h3>
        <p>
            The level is structured like a traditional dungeon, guiding the player from
            the starting area through combat encounters, traps, and gated progression.
            Timed events and environmental triggers require the player to complete specific
            tasks in order to unlock new areas, reinforcing pacing and challenge escalation.
        </p>

        <h3>Weapon Pickups, Power-Ups, and Traps</h3>
        <p>
            The player can acquire weapons such as a sword during gameplay, altering combat
            behavior and available actions. Power-ups temporarily enhance abilities, while
            trap systems introduce environmental hazards. These systems are tightly integrated
            with the level logic to ensure they meaningfully affect player decision-making.
        </p>

        <h3>Combo-Based Combat System</h3>
        <p>
            Combat is built around a flexible combo system using light and heavy attacks.
            Inputs can be chained in multiple patterns such as light-light-heavy (1-1-2)
            or heavy-light-heavy (2-1-2), allowing for varied combat strategies. The system
            was designed to support future expansion without rewriting core logic.
        </p>

        <h3>UI, Sound Cues, and Player Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            UI elements and sound cues provide constant feedback to the player, indicating
            successful hits, combo progression, power-up activation, and objective status.
            These cues are essential for maintaining clarity during fast-paced combat and
            time-sensitive events within the dungeon.
        </p>

        <h3>Final Boss Encounter</h3>
        <p>
            The dungeon concludes with a final boss fight that requires mastery of the
            combat and movement systems introduced throughout the level. The encounter
            serves as a validation of the full gameplay loop, combining combat, timing,
            and situational awareness to complete the level.
