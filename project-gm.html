        <p>
            <strong>Project G_M</strong> expands directly on the previous Vaulting & Climbing project,
            bringing together advanced movement, combat systems, animation fidelity, AI behavior,
            and UI into a single cohesive gameplay prototype. The goal was to push system interaction
            and polish closer to production-level gameplay.

<!-- DETAILED EXPLANATION -->
<section class="wrapper style1">
    <div class="title">System Breakdown</div>
    <div class="container">

        <h3>Expansion of Traversal & Movement</h3>
        <p>
            Project G_M builds on the earlier vaulting and climbing systems by introducing
            additional traversal mechanics such as rolling, sliding, and cover-based movement.
            These systems are layered on top of a shared movement state framework to prevent
            conflicts while maintaining responsiveness and player control.
        </p>

        <h3>IK Systems & Animation Fidelity</h3>
        <p>
            The character animation system combines IK leg placement for grounding with
            FABRIK-based hand IK to ensure accurate weapon alignment. Turn-in-place animations
            handle large rotation changes while idle or aiming, improving visual clarity and
            eliminating unnatural snapping during rotation.
        </p>

        <h3>Weapon Handling & Gunplay</h3>
        <p>
            Gunplay systems support multiple weapon types, each with its own ammo pool and
            firing behavior. Weapon sway is applied dynamically based on movement and camera
            input, reinforcing weight and responsiveness. All weapon logic is tightly integrated
            with animation and IK to maintain consistency during combat.
        </p>

        <h3>Cover System & Tactical Movement</h3>
        <p>
            The cover system allows the player to dynamically enter and exit cover, blending
            smoothly with aiming, firing, and traversal. Sliding and rolling mechanics provide
            additional evasive options, encouraging fluid movement during combat encounters.
        </p>

        <h3>Enemy AI Using EQS</h3>
        <p>
            Multiple grunt enemy AI types were implemented using Unreal’s Environment Query
            System (EQS). AI agents evaluate positions for cover, attack angles, and movement,
            allowing them to react dynamically to player positioning and combat state.
        </p>

        <h3>UI & Player Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            A lightweight UI system displays player health and weapon-specific ammo counts.
            UI updates are driven directly by gameplay state changes to ensure accuracy during
            fast-paced combat and traversal, reinforcing player awareness at all times.
