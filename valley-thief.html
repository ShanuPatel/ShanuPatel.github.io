<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<section class="wrapper style2">
    <div class="title">Project Overview</div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            <strong>Valley Thief</strong> is a single-player stealth-action prototype built
            to deeply understand Unreal Engine’s internal gameplay architecture.
            The project avoids Blueprint-heavy workflows and instead focuses on
            building systems directly in C++ to gain low-level control and clarity.

<!-- DETAILED EXPLANATION -->
<section class="wrapper style1">
    <div class="title">Development Breakdown</div>
    <div class="container">

        <h3>C++-First Gameplay Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The entire project was developed using C++ as the primary scripting layer.
            Core gameplay systems such as player movement, stealth logic, interaction,
            combat, UI updates, and mission flow were all implemented without relying on
            Blueprint-driven logic. This approach helped maintain deterministic behavior,
            easier debugging, and a clearer understanding of Unreal’s gameplay framework.
        </p>

        <h3>Animation Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
            All character animations were authored from scratch in Blender and then
            integrated into Unreal Engine. Custom animation states were connected to
            gameplay logic through C++-driven animation control, ensuring smooth
            transitions while reacting accurately to player actions such as movement,
            crouching, stealth interactions, and combat.
        </p>

        <h3>Stealth-Focused Design</h3>
        <p>
            Stealth is the primary design pillar of the project. Enemy awareness,
            player visibility, and interaction feedback were designed to reinforce
            stealth-based decision making. The gameplay systems prioritize clarity,
            giving the player readable feedback on detection, objectives, and risk.
        </p>

        <h3>User Interface & Mission Flow</h3>
        <p>
            The UI was designed to support gameplay without overwhelming the player.
            Ammo counts, active objectives, and mission progress are clearly displayed
            and updated through C++ systems. The entire mission, from start to end,
            is structured to maintain immersion and reinforce stealth as the main focus.
        </p>

        <h3>Solo Development</h3>
        <p>
            This project was built entirely by a single developer, covering gameplay
            programming, animation creation, system design, and integration. This
            demonstrates the ability to own a full vertical slice and manage multiple
            disciplines within a single production pipeline.
