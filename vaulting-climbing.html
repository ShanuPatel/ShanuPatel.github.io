        <p>
            This project was built to explore advanced character traversal and animation
            systems in Unreal Engine. The focus was on implementing vaulting, climbing,
            and simple parkour mechanics while maintaining stable animation blending,
            grounded movement, and responsive player control using C++.

<!-- DETAILED EXPLANATION -->
<section class="wrapper style1">
    <div class="title">System Breakdown</div>
    <div class="container">

        <h3>IK Leg Placement & Ground Detection</h3>
        <p>
            The project demonstrates inverse kinematics for leg placement to ensure
            the character’s feet properly align with uneven terrain and stairs.
            Line traces are used to detect surface height and normals, allowing
            the animation system to dynamically adjust foot position and rotation
            for more believable grounded movement.
        </p>

        <h3>Stairs Handling & Traversal Stability</h3>
        <p>
            Special attention was given to stair traversal, where traditional animation
            often breaks immersion. By combining IK leg adjustment with movement state
            checks, the character maintains consistent footing while ascending or
            descending steps, reducing foot sliding and clipping.
        </p>

        <h3>Vaulting, Climbing, and Parkour Mechanics</h3>
        <p>
            Vaulting and climbing systems were implemented to explore basic parkour-style
            movement. Environmental detection using traces determines whether an obstacle
            can be vaulted over or climbed. These mechanics are designed to blend smoothly
            with standard movement without interrupting player control.
        </p>

        <h3>Weapon UI & Combat Context</h3>
        <p>
            A simple UI system displays ammo counts for different weapon types, allowing
            the project to test traversal while armed. This ensures that vaulting,
            climbing, and movement transitions do not interfere with weapon handling
            or HUD updates.
        </p>

        <h3>Basic Enemy AI</h3>
        <p>
            Basic enemy AI was included to validate traversal mechanics under gameplay
            pressure. Enemies provide minimal combat interaction, helping test how
            movement, animation, and IK systems behave when the player is forced to
            react quickly or reposition during traversal.
        </p>

        <h3>Goal of the Project</h3>
        <p>
            The primary goal was not to build a full game, but to understand how
            traversal, animation, IK, and combat-adjacent systems interact at the
            C++ level. This project serves as a foundation for more advanced movement
            and parkour systems in future gameplay prototypes.
