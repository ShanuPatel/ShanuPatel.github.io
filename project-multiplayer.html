            The project explores scalable multiplayer architecture, replicated gameplay
            systems, and production-style online features such as server browsing and hosting.

<!-- DETAILED SYSTEM EXPLANATION -->
<section class="wrapper style1">
    <div class="title">System Breakdown</div>
    <div class="container">

        <h3>Networking & Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            The project uses a client-server authoritative networking model where all
            gameplay-critical logic is validated and executed on the server. Player movement,
            combat actions, weapon usage, and power-up states are replicated to ensure fairness
            and consistency across all connected clients.
        </p>

        <h3>Server Browser & Steam Play</h3>
        <p>
            A server browser allows players to host or join multiplayer matches seamlessly.
            The system was designed with Steam play in mind, enabling session discovery,
            connection handling, and match flow similar to production multiplayer titles.
        </p>

        <h3>Weapon & Inventory System</h3>
        <p>
            Players can equip up to two main weapons and one sidearm pistol. Each weapon type
            maintains its own ammo pool and firing behavior. Grenades are handled as a limited
            resource, with players able to carry up to four at a time, all synchronized across
            the network.
        </p>

        <h3>Power-Ups & Pickups</h3>
        <p>
            The game includes multiple power-ups such as shields, super jump, and ammo pickups.
            Each power-up has its own duration or counter and is replicated to all clients.
            The HUD displays active power-ups and remaining effects to keep players informed
            during fast-paced gameplay.
        </p>

        <h3>HUD & Player Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            The HUD displays weapon ammo, grenade count, player health, and active power-ups.
            All UI elements are driven by replicated gameplay state to ensure accuracy and
            responsiveness, even under high network load.
        </p>

        <h3>Game Modes & Replication</h3>
        <p>
            Each game mode defines its own win conditions and scoring logic, all executed on
            the server. Objective states, scores, and match progression are replicated to
            guarantee synchronization and prevent client-side manipulation.
